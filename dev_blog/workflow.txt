Ok don't laugh. 

pls

Running main console on Arch in my room. SSHing into a Debian machine in my living room.

Since no GUI i have started working on my vim skills and let me tell you boy am I bad.

Currently figuring out networking between mongodb container and bot container. Both on docker. 
Also running a test file and when things work out I overwrite bot.py with the functioning code from test. 
Going all the way back to before git with this kind of versioning lulz. 

Let's hope soon I will figure things out and this will all be behind me. 
(though more likely I will just find out a whole lot of cool tools to over-engineer this and will have the infastructure set up for a non-existent app.
