I have no clue how to make MD pretty so until I figure that out please bear with me :D

Technical Changes:
	1. Changed from base command to slash command for user clarity. 
	2. Added cogs folder for clarity and encapsulation.
		a. I'll have to clear up some of the code but is currently working. 
	3. Added the readme file though I will also create a md file to track the changes to scope and features as they happen.

Scope Changes:
	1. I realized that PostgreSQL was not the best tool for my current objective. I'm switching over to MongoDB.
		a. I prefer the document data structure as oppossed to the relational/table methods of PGSQL
		b. At least for the monster_stat_block I'll utilize Mongo. I am considering handling the character sheet aspect with PGSQL.
	2. I am now trying to set-up a docker image with the bot. 
		a. I am considering running the db in the same image, though have not yet dismissed using some orchestration tools to over-engineer this project. 
		b. I also must consider data integrity/safety which is a whole other horder of monsters. 
	3. After realizing how long manual input will take, I may have to automate this process.
		a. My current consideration is web-scrapping DNDBeyond though a computer vision project to scan and restructure pages from the physical books sounds just as interesting. 
		b. I definitely need to do something to reduce manual input. 

Some Other Notes:
	1. I have to work on my CI/CD to automate all the manual work I'm doing right now specially with how poorly I've set-up things.

Thanks for reading this far. Have a good one :D
